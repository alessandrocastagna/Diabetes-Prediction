# Diabetes Prediction  

## Overview  
This project explores whether it is possible to classify if a person is likely or unlikely to have diabetes based on a dataset. This challenge was presented in the **Kaggle Community Competitions**, hosted by **Knime**.

## Objective  
The goal of this analysis is to identify the best-performing machine learning model for predicting diabetes risk. The model evaluates whether an individual may develop diabetes based on various factors, including:  
- Pre-existing diseases  
- Socioeconomic status  
- Diet and lifestyle  
- Family medical history  

## Model Evaluation  
As per the competition rules, the best model is selected based on the **Log Loss** function, which is a key metric used to measure the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy and overall performance.  

## Dataset & Implementation  
The dataset consists of multiple health and demographic features that influence diabetes risk. Various machine learning techniques are applied to train and optimize models for accurate classification.
